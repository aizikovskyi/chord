# chord

A chord-based musical instrument for smartphones. It is meant as a practice tool for singers and songwriters - a replacement for strumming chords on guitar.

To use, open https://aizikovskyi.github.io/chord/ in a smartphone browser. Use landscape mode. Firefox seems to work best on Android.

# How to play: the basics

The instrument has three components: the **mute bass button**, the **keyboard**, and the **chord grid**. The keyboard plays the bass note, and the chord grid plays the chord above it.

Play a note on the keyboard. While the note is held down, use the chord grid to play a chord with that note as the root. **Without a root note, the chord grid is disabled**.

For simple strumming, simultaneously tap a bass note and a chord in a rhythmic strumming pattern.

# More advanced usage

### Holding the bass

You can play chords as long as a bass key is held down. For example, you can play the bass on the first beat, hold it down the rest of the measure, and play a rhythmic pattern using the chord grid.

### Free bass

When you hold down a key on the bass keyboard, it is highlighted in green and becomes the root for the chords. As long as it is held down, pressing other keys will play them but will not change the root. Use this to play more advanced bass lines while strumming a chord.

### No bass

Holding down the "mute bass" button mutes the bass keyboard. Use it to play "rootless" chords.

### Wrong bass

This is the most difficult technique - a combination of the previous two. Let's say you want to play C7/Bb. This is how you do it:

*Before* the beat, hold down "mute bass", hold down C on the piano keyboard, and release "mute bass". Keep holding C.

On the beat, while still holding C, simultaneously press Bb on the piano keyboard and 7 on the chord grid.
